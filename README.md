# Misc Utilities

Many of these utilities were sourced from [RoboDanny](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny) and as such their respective license headers mention this.

I have applied my own edits to some files, these will not be marked explicitly however.

This repo assumes that the top level has a `_types` directory as tihs is utilised in many places until I devise a saner solution.
